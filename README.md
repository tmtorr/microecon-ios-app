# Micro Economics
A User Friendly app built in Xcode, with a back-end written in Swift. It tests the user on their knowledge of intro microeconomics through multiple choice questions with hand drawn illustrations.  

All code was written by me in Apple's Swift programming language, and visual assets were drawn by me. It helped me study for a microeconomics class I took over the summer!
